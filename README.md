# Freight Pallet Calculator

A simple web-based tool to calculate freight ready pallet sizes efficiently.

## Demo

You can try out the live demo here: [Freight Pallet Calculator](https://dhextras.github.io/freight-pallet-calc)

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need a web browser. No additional software is required.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/dhextras/freight-pallet-calc.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How It Works

This tool efficiently calculates the optimal size for freight pallets. It allows you to enter product dimensions and weights, and then it distributes these products across pallets, ensuring that weight and height constraints are met. The tool uses intelligent algorithms to optimize the arrangement of products to minimize wasted space on pallets.

For a detailed explanation of how the calculator works and how the code achieves this, please refer to the `allocateProducts` & `addProductToPallet` Functions in the [script.js](script.js) file. You will find explanations and references to specific parts of the code, making it easier to understand the logic.
